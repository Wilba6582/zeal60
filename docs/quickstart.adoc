= Zeal60 CL tool
:experimental:

zeal60.exe is a command-line tool for changing keymaps and backlight configuration.


. Program `zeal60_default.hex` using Flip.
. Disconnect USB
. Connect USB
. Double-click on one of the `zeal60_keymap_*.bat` files to program a layout


== Defaults

Depending on the layout, `Fn1` and `Fn2` are assigned to right Win and Menu keys, or to split-shift `Fn` key and right Win key.
The default backlight controls are on layer 3, which is (by default) enabled by holding down `Fn1` and `Fn2`

TIP: When the zeal60 firmware is programmed, holding kbd:[Space] + kbd:[Esc] while powering on (i.e. connecting USB to keyboard) will reset *ALL* stored settings (keymaps, backlight, etc.) and start the bootloader so it is ready for firmware programming with Flip. If you only want to reset the stored settings, disconnect/connect USB and the firmware is restarted.

== Batch Files

The preferred way to use it is by editing a "batch" file, which will execute zeal60.exe and pass it information via command-line arguments.

NOTE: Batch files use the `pass:[^]` symbol to break a single line into multiple lines. Make sure these are at the end of each line when the command-line arguments span multiple lines.

The example batch files should be used as a base for changing things to your preference.

* Copy a batch file and then edit it to your preference.
* double-click the batch file to execute the batch file. A command-line window will open to show progress.

== Zeal60 Commands

The following explains what commands are being used in the batch files to achieve backlight configuration and keymap configuration.

```c
zeal60 backlight_config_set_values [ name=value ] ... 
```

Name/value pairs:

```c
use_split_backspace=<0|1>
use_split_left_shift=<0|1> 
use_split_right_shift=<0|1> 
use_7u_spacebar=<0|1> 
use_iso_enter=<0|1>
```

Configures which switches are being used, so that LEDs not under a switch will be disabled.
It needs to be combined with soldering the jumpers on the PCB to match the switches being used, to connect one of two LEDs to the LED matrix.
`0` is false, `1` is true. e.g. `use_split_backspace=1` enables split backspace LEDs.

`disable_when_usb_suspended=<0|1>`

Turn off backlight when the USB is suspended, i.e. when the PC is in Sleep/Hibernate/Shutdown mode.

`disable_after_timeout=N`

Turn off backlight after no keypresses for `N` minutes.

`brightness=N`

Global brightness setting, `N` in range `0-100`

`effect=N`

Backlight effect, `N` in range `0-9` (see above for list)

```
color_1=H,S,V
color_2=H,S,V
```

Set the colors used in backlight effects

```
caps_lock_indicator_color=H,S,V
layer_1_indicator_color=H,S,V
layer_2_indicator_color=H,S,V
layer_3_indicator_color=H,S,V
```

Set the color used for Caps Lock and active layer indicators

```
caps_lock_indicator_row_col=<ROW,COL|all|none>
layer_1_indicator_row_col=<ROW,COL|all|none>
layer_2_indicator_row_col=<ROW,COL|all|none>
layer_3_indicator_row_col=<ROW,COL|all|none>
```

Set the LEDs used for Caps Lock and active layer indicators.
ROW/COL specify which switch in the switch matrix, e.g.;

```
ANSI Caps Lock Key:  caps_lock_indicator_row_col=0,2
Spacebar+stabs:      caps_lock_indicator_row_col=4,7
Esc Key:             caps_lock_indicator_row_col=0,0
Left Win Key:        caps_lock_indicator_row_col=4,1
Right Win Key:       caps_lock_indicator_row_col=4,11
Right Menu Key:      caps_lock_indicator_row_col=4,12
HHKB Fn Key:         caps_lock_indicator_row_col=3,13
All keys:            caps_lock_indicator_row_col=all 
None:                caps_lock_indicator_row_col=none
```

NOTE: Use `layer_3_indicator_row_col=none` if you use the default layer 3 keymaps which change the backlight.


`zeal60 backlight_config_set_alphas_mods [ ALPHA | MOD ] ...`

This command configures which switches in the switch matrix are alphanumeric keys and which are modifiers.
This is used in backlight effects which set the LEDs under alphanumeric and modifier keys to different colors.

`zeal60 keymap <layer> <keycode> ...`

This command sets the keycodes in a keymap. layer is `0` to `3`. keycode is a QMK keycode name, e.g. `KC_ESC`, `KC_1`, `KC_2` etc.

This is how the default keymaps are configured:

* Keymap 0 is the default keymap, what you expect keys to do when not holding down a `Fn` key.
* Keymap 1 is the `Fn1` keymap, what you expect keys to do when holding down `Fn1` key.
* Keymap 2 is the `Fn2` keymap, what you expect keys to do when holding down `Fn2` key.
* Keymap 3 is the "configuration" keymap, what you expect keys to do when holding down `Fn1` and `Fn2` keys simultaneously.

The switch matrix is 5 rows and 14 columns.
Due to split keys, ISO, winkey/winkeyless support, some positions in the keymap will be empty/not used.
Here are the row/column positions of multiple-position keys:

[hardbreaks]
`[0,13]` is either left key of split backspace (e.g. HHKB `\|` key) or 2U backspace
`[1,13]` is either backslash or ISO Enter
`[2,12]` is either ANSI Enter or key left of ISO Enter
`[2,13]` is right key of split backspace (e.g. HHKB pass:[f~] key)
`[3,1]` is right key of split left-shift (e.g ISO key)
`[3,13]` is right key of split right-shift (e.g. HHKB `Fn` key)
`[4,7]` is space bar

NOTE: the least obvious of the above is the right key of the split backspace, which is to the right of the ANSI Enter.

Keycode names match the ones QMK uses, so in a lot of cases, you can copy them from existing QMK keymap.c files.

NOTE: Keycode KC_NO means don't output any keycode when this switch is pressed. It is present in the batch files to show switches which would not be present for that layout, like keys on an ISO keyboard not being present on an ANSI keyboard.

NOTE: Keycode KC_TRNS means when this layer is active, use the keycode for the layer "below" it. Use it in keymaps 1, 2 and 3 to fill in the positions where you don't have a keycode you want for that layer, especially in the position "above" keycodes that change layers, like Fn keys.

== QMK Keycodes

Refer to QMK Firmware documentation for keycode symbols and a general understanding of how the keymaps work.

* https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware
* https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/blob/master/doc/keycode.txt
* https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/wiki#switching-and-toggling-layers

Special QMK keycodes like `MO(layer)`, `LT(layer,kc)`, `LCTRL(kc)`, etc. will work, however they must not include any spaces when they appear in the batch file.
You *can* nest them, like `LALT(LCTL(KC_DEL))`

Avoid using `DF(layer)` unless you REALLY know what you are doing.

NOTE: Expert QMK users can use a hex string like `0x12FE` to specify any QMK keycode, or compile their own custom QMK firmware with actions/macros and use `FN0`-`FN31` to trigger them.

=== Notable QMK Keycodes

[horizontal]
`KC_PWR` :: PC power down (or sleep)
`KC_SLEP` :: PC sleep
`RESET` :: start the bootloader so new firmware can be programmed with Flip (useful for power users that build their own firmware, casual users can use kbd:[Space] + kbd:[Esc] while powering on)

=== Media

[horizontal]
`KC_MUTE` :: mute
`KC_VOLU` :: volume up
`KC_VOLD` :: volume down
`KC_CALC` :: open calculator

=== Layers

[horizontal]
`MO(1)` :: Momentary enable layer 1 while held
`LT(1,KC_CAPS)` :: Enable layer 1 while held, Caps Lock when tapped


== Special Zeal60 Keycodes

[horizontal]
`FN_MO13` :: hold for layer 1, hold with FN_MO23 for layer 3
`FN_MO23` :: hold for layer 2, hold with FN_MO13 for layer 3

NOTE: Use both these keycodes in a layout to get `Fn1 + Fn2 = Fn3` functionality

[horizontal]
`FN_TT13` :: hold for layer 1, triple-tap to toggle on/off layer 3
`FN_TT23` :: hold for layer 2, triple-tap to toggle on/off layer 3
`TG_NKRO` :: toggle NKRO on/off and store the setting

=== Zeal60 Backlight Control Keycodes:

[horizontal]
`EF_DEC` :: backlight effect decrement
`EF_INC` :: backlight effect increment
`H1_DEC` :: color 1 hue decrement
`H1_INC` :: color 1 hue increment
`H2_DEC` :: color 2 hue decrement
`H2_INC` :: color 2 hue increment
`BR_DEC` :: brightness decrement
`BR_INC` :: brightness increment
`S1_DEC` :: color 1 saturation decrement
`S1_INC` :: color 1 saturation increment
`S2_DEC` :: color 2 saturation increment
`S2_INC` :: color 2 saturation increment


`zeal60 colors <named colors> <keymap>`

This command sets the colors used in the "Custom Key Colors" backlight effect, allowing the user to change the color of every key.
Rather than a huge 2D array of RGB colors (hard to change), this command lets you bind a color in HSV (hue, saturation, brightness) to a name, and then use that name in a "keymap".

Let's break down what's happening in the example batch file:

```
zeal60 colors ^
ROW0=hsv(260,100,100) ^
ROW1=hsv(270,95,100) ^
ROW2=hsv(280,90,100) ^
ROW3=hsv(290,85,100) ^
ROW4=hsv(300,80,100) ^
MODS=hsv(180,100,100) ^
MODS     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     ROW0     MODS    ^
MODS     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     ROW1     MODS    ^
MODS     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     ROW2     MODS     MODS    ^
MODS     MODS     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     ROW3     MODS     MODS    ^
MODS     MODS     MODS     ROW4     ROW4     ROW4     ROW4     ROW4     ROW4     ROW4     ROW4     MODS     MODS     MODS    
```


This defines 6 named colors `ROW0`, `ROW1`, `ROW2`, `ROW3`, `ROW4`, `MODS`.
`hsv(...)` defines a color with hue 260, saturation 100%, brightness 100%
Use http://colorizer.org/ to assist in choosing HSV values.

NOTE: Spaces cannot be present when defining named colors, or broken across multiple lines with `pass:[^]`.

NOTE: The "Custom Key Colors" backlight effect uses the global brightness control, so the brightness of a named color is not used.

The first occurrence of text which isn't a named color (i.e. doesn't have the "=") will be the start of a "keymap" of where to use those colors.

In this example, the `MODS` color is used in the locations of modifier keys, and the other colors are used for the alphanumeric keys, a different one per row.
The effect is something similar to the Alphas/Mods backlight effect, but with a vertical color gradient for the alphas.

You can define as many colors as you like, and use any name you like, as long as it does not contain spaces or `=`.
It is preferrable to keep names short and of the same length, so it's easy to construct the "keymap" with copy/paste.

[NOTE]
--
The "keymap" for colors is the same arrangement as the keymap for keycodes, thus:

* The right key of split backspace is at `[2,13]`.
* The left spacebar stabilizer LED is at `[4,3]`
* The right spacebar stabilizer LED is at `[4,9]` (use `[4,9]` for 6.25U spacebar layout. For 7U spacebar layout use `[4,10]`)
