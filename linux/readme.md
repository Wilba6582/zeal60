To compile the Linux version you can use the supplied makefile in the zeal60 dir. Make sure you have installed the hidapi library before. You can copy the compiled binary to your path (for example /usr/local/bin/). You need to run it as root or place the provided udev rule file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ , the provided udev rules file gives write access to the usb device for everyone in the zeal60 group. You should either change this to another group, or make this group and add yourself to it ( groupadd zeal60; gpasswd -a user zeal60 ).
